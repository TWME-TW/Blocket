Welcome to the Blocket documentation! Blocket is a powerful Minecraft plugin library that enables developers to create client-side virtual blocks that are invisible to the server but visible to specific players.

## What is Blocket?

Blocket allows you to create virtual blocks that exist only on the client-side. These blocks are:
- **Invisible to the server** - No server lag or world modifications
- **Player-specific** - Only certain players can see them
- **Interactive** - Players can break, place, and interact with them
- **High-performance** - Optimized for large-scale virtual structures
